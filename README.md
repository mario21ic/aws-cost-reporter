# AWS Cost Report

This tool will collect and create Daily & Monthly AWS cost reports and put them into [Slack](https://slack.com/)

The format should be like this

```
<date> - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Instance1): $<value>
<date> - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Instance2): $<value>
<date> - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (InstanceN): $<value>
<date> - Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR): <value>
<date> - Amazon Simple Storage Service: $<value>
<date> - AWS Key Management Service: $<value>
<date> - AWS Data Pipeline: $<value>
```
Total Spent: `<value>`

## Before Start

This tool uses a specific file that is generated by AWS. To activate the generation, you should activate the [Detailed billing report with resources and tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-reports.html#other-reports)

## Recomendations

In order to fully take advantage of the potential, you should Tag your resources accordingly, otherwise you will see a lot of this

```
<date> - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (): $<value>
```

## Instructions

This function could be set to be used as standalone, but the way we use it is by setting a [AWS Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), and a [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function

Since this project uses `node_modules`, we have 2 ways of passing the code to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

- Uploading to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- Creating a ZIP file and uploading to Lambda (We usually use this, but could be changed)

## Installation

- Create a ZIP file
- Upload to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- Set the [AWS Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) to call the function on the desired period of time
- You are all set
